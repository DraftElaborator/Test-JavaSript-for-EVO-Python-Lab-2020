This page will ask your name and remember it but..
until you reload the page.
Here are 2 "admins" Jack and John, they names areaded automaticaly
for checking some funcions even if you have not entered the name.
First time program will say Hello
Second time the program will say? that have met you already.

P.S. I am really noob in JavaScript.
I just started to learn it.
So I dont know jet how to add and save data from/to page.
Thats why names are saved in a simple massive,
that wil erase each time you reload the page.
